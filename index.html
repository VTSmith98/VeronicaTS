              <p> My Name is Veronica T. Smith and I am a Sophomore at Florida Gulf Coast University, Majoring in Mathematics and Minoring in Education. I aspire to be an International Educator and Travel the world. Throughout my college career, I've collaborated and joined a multitude of diverse organizations on campus. Before even coming to college I was a mentee at FROSH MOSH, which is a weekend retreat that the Office of Multicultural and Leadership Development host for incoming freshmen that teaches about social issues and about the campus. After that, I continued working alongside MLD and join their many retreats and Programs, such as; Emerging Eagles, Leadership Academy, Beyond The Lines, and LeaderShape. Each of these helped mold me and aided me in my future involvement. Through the networking of each retreat, I was able to meet people that helped me become, A Certified Peers Care Educator, a FROSH MOSH Peer Mentor, and helps me in the leadership positions that I hold currently.</p>
      <p>Once I graduate from Florida Gulf Coast University, my plan is to travel the world and become an International Educator. However, before I just pack and leave I plan to do four years of teaching in the state of Florida, and in those four years also do research on the Math Curriculum in Florida but also work with other teachers from different states. With this I want to revamp the way math is taught and comprehended in the United States, and how is it compared to students from different countries. How is it taught differently? Is it more collaborative? Or more independent? Once that is accomplished, I would also like to open up my own international math program, to help guide students that want to join that field.</p>
