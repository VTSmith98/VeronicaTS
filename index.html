    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>
      Hello,
      <br>
      My Name is Veronica T. Smith and I am a Sophomore at Florida Gulf Coast University, Majoring in Mathematics. 
      I aspire to be an International Educator and Travel the world. Throughout my college career I've collaboarted
      and joined a multitude of diverse organization on campus. Before even coming to college I was a mentee at FROSH MOSH,
      which is a weekend retreat that the Office of Multicultural and Leadership Development host for incoming freshmen that
      teaches about social issues and about the campus. After that I continued working a long side MLD and join thier many retreats
      and Programs, such as; Emerging Eagles, Leadership Academy, Beyond The Lines, and LeaderShape. Each of these helped mold me
      and aided me in my future involvement. Through the networking of each retreat, I was able to meet people that helped me become,
      A Certified Peers Care Educator, a FROSH MOSH Peer Mentor, and helps me in the leadership positions that I hold currently.
